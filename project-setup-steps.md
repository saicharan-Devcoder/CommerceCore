## Installation Guide


To set up a new Node.js project, you need to initialize it with a `package.json` file. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm init -y
```


## Install Development Tools (Optional)

To enhance your development workflow, you can install `ts-node` and `nodemon`. These tools help streamline development by allowing you to run TypeScript files directly and automatically restart the server during changes.

Run the following command to install these tools as development dependencies:

```bash
npm install ts-node nodemon --save-dev
```

```bash
npm install apollo-server graphql mongoose
```
